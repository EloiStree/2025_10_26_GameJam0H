For the story of the 3D UFO mesh:

> I tried to make a car and accidentally made a wheel that looked like a UFO.
> So I turned it into a UFO and made a drone game out of it for students.
> Maude was kind enough to refactor it to look nicer in 3D and with UVs.
> At least it’s less bad than it was xD. I’m a developer, not an artist.
